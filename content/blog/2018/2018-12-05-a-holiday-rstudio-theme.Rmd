## &#x1F385; &#x1F936; 'Tis the season to be jolly!

Bring yuletide cheer and seasons greetings to your [favorite R IDE](https://rstudio.com). Based on the [Yule tmTheme][yule-base] and modified to fit in well with RStudio Dark Mode. It's surprisingly pleasant and merrily festive!

### Download with R

Use this code to download the theme file straight into the RStudio themes directory.

```r
# I've only tested on Mac
library(fs)
rsthemes_dir <- path_home(".R", "rstudio", "themes")
dir_create(rsthemes_dir)
download.file(
  "https://git.io/yule-rstudio",
  path(rsthemes_dir, "Yule-RStudio.rstheme")
)
```

## How I Made This

I made this the way I do all web development: right-click on the thing I want to change, choose **Inspect Element**, and hack at it until it looks reasonable.
Somehow this even works in RStudio! 
(It's a web app underneath.)

As a starting point, though, I used found the [Yule theme][yule-base] on the [tmTheme Editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) and fiddled with the base colors there until they worked well with RStudio's blueish dark theme.

The upcoming 1.2 version of RStudio now 
[supports adding themes](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/installation_notes.md), 
and `.tmTheme` files are converted automatically into RStudio's `.rstheme` format.
Turns out, an `.rstheme` is just CSS!

This got me half the way there, but there were still a number of missing elements that I wanted to tweak. 
Figuring out how tmTheme scopes get mapped to [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) CSS classes was painful trial and error.
To get the theme all the way there, I went straight to the source. 
I opened up a few scripts and R Markdown documents, used **Insepect Element** to identify the appropriate Ace CSS class, and then fiddled until it looked ~~great~~ good enough.

The blinking Christmas-light cursor is just a CSS animation!

```css
.normal-mode .ace_cursor {
  border: 0!important;
  animation-name: color;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: step-start;
  opacity: 0.75;
}

@keyframes color {
  0% {
    background-color: #ff00a9;
  }
  20% {
    background-color: #7c3eff;
  }
  40% {
    background-color: #64f3f0;
  }
  60% {
    background-color: #4fe818;
  }
  80% {
    background-color: #ffc400;
  }
  100 {
    background-color: #ff0010;
  }
}
```
